# Sustainable Solar-Powered E-Paper Digital Advertising System

![E-Paper Display](Images/e_paper.jpg)

This project presents an eco-friendly digital advertising solution that replaces conventional high-power LED/LCD billboards with **solar-powered E-Paper displays**. Designed for smart city environments, it operates **fully off-grid**, offers **high sunlight visibility**, and consumes **ultra-low power** — making it a long-term sustainable alternative to traditional digital signage.

## Problem Statement

Digital advertising has become essential in communication and marketing but typically depends on **LED/LCD displays**, which:

- Consume high power continuously
- Require frequent maintenance
- Contribute to light pollution and energy waste
- Are not sustainable for long-term environmental goals

There is a demand for a **greener, cost-efficient, and sustainable advertising alternative**.

---

## Proposed Solution

We introduce a **Solar-Powered E-Paper Display System** where:

- **Solar Panels** generate energy  
- **MPPT controller** ensures efficient power usage  
- **Battery backup** ensures 24×7 operation  
- **E-Paper Display** shows advertisements with **near-zero power consumption** (only uses power during content updates)
- **Raspberry Pi 3B+** enables remote content control and IoT connectivity

This drastically reduces energy consumption, eliminates grid dependency, and supports sustainable smart city development.

## Innovation & Uniqueness

Unlike LED/LCD displays, **E-Paper consumes power only when the screen content changes**, making it ideal for continuous outdoor advertisements. Paired with **solar energy and MPPT**, this system:

- Eliminates grid electricity usage
- Reduces operational & maintenance cost
- Supports government smart city & green initiatives

This solution modernizes advertising while **protecting the environment**.
